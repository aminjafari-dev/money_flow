### General UI/UX Design Rules for the Finance App

Based on the provided screenshots, the app's design is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly, emphasizing simplicity, readability, and quick access to financial data. It effectively uses visual hierarchy, color coding, and minimalism to make budgeting and tracking feel effortless and non-overwhelming. Here are the key general rules distilled from the overall design:

1. **Color Scheme and Theming**:
   - Primary background: White or light gray (#FFFFFF or #F5F5F5) for a clean, modern look.
   - Accent color: Blue (#007BFF or similar) for interactive elements like buttons (e.g., "Save", "Add Category") and navigation highlights.
   - Semantic colors: Green (#28A745) for positive values (income, success indicators); Red/Orange (#DC3545 or #FD7E14) for negative values (expenses, warnings); Yellow (#FFC107) for alerts or progress.
   - Neutral grays (#6C757D) for secondary text and borders.
   - Support dark mode toggle, inverting colors for accessibility (e.g., dark background #121212, light text).

2. **Typography**:
   - Headings: Bold sans-serif font (e.g., SF Pro or Roboto Bold) at 18-24pt for page titles (e.g., "Add Transaction", "Analytics").
   - Body text: Regular sans-serif at 14-16pt for labels and descriptions.
   - Values: Larger bold font (20-32pt) for key figures like amounts (e.g., "$2,500").
   - Consistency: Limit to 2-3 font weights; ensure high contrast (AA/AAA accessibility standards).

3. **Layout and Structure**:
   - Mobile-first: Vertical scrolling with fixed bottom navigation bar (icons: Home, Transactions, Analytics, Settings/Categories).
   - Cards and Sections: Rounded corners (8-12px radius) with subtle shadows or borders for separation (e.g., transaction items, category lists).
   - White Space: Generous padding (16-24px) around elements to avoid clutter; use dividers or spacing for grouping (e.g., categories, trends).
   - Progress Bars: Horizontal bars with percentage labels, color-coded to match semantics (e.g., green for on-track budgets).
   - Forms: Stacked inputs with rounded fields; toggle buttons for categories/subcategories.

4. **Icons and Visuals**:
   - Use simple, outline-style icons (e.g., from Material Icons or custom set) for categories (fork/knife for Food, car for Transportation).
   - Consistent size: 24-32px, colored to match category or semantic (e.g., blue for neutral, green/red for values).
   - Charts/Graphs: Simple bar and line charts with smooth curves; no overcrowding—focus on 4-6 data points max per view.

5. **Interaction and UX Principles**:
   - Navigation: Bottom tab bar for quick switching; top back arrows for hierarchy.
   - Feedback: Immediate visual cues (e.g., checkmarks for success, warnings for over-budget).
   - Accessibility: Tap targets ≥48px; alt text for icons; scalable text.
   - Simplicity: Limit options per screen (e.g., 5-7 categories); use dropdowns/filters for time periods (Weekly/Monthly/Yearly).
   - Error Handling: Subtle red highlights for issues (e.g., low charity progress).
   - Responsiveness: Adapt to screen sizes, ensuring no horizontal scrolling.

6. **Overall Philosophy**:
   - Minimalist and Empowering: Focus on glanceable insights (e.g., dashboards with summaries) to encourage positive financial habits without overwhelming users.
   - Consistency Across Pages: Reuse components (e.g., transaction list items appear in home, transactions, analytics).
   - User-Centric: Prioritize common actions (add transaction via floating + button); provide insights and suggestions subtly.

These rules ensure the app feels polished, accessible, and efficient, aligning with modern finance apps like Mint or YNAB.

### JSON Prompting for UI/UX Design

This JSON structure can be used as a prompt template for tools like AI design generators (e.g., Figma plugins, UI code generators) or to define a design system. It captures the essence of the app's style in a structured, reusable format. You can feed this into a system to regenerate or extend similar screens.
