### UI/UX Design Rules for the Dashboard Page

This Dashboard page serves as the app's home screen, providing a high-level overview of the user's financial status at a glance. It prioritizes scannability, motivational visuals, and quick navigation to encourage regular engagement. The design adheres to the app's overall minimalist philosophy but focuses on summary cards and a compact transaction feed. Below are the exact, detailed rules derived from the page's structure, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and usability.

#### 1. **Overall Layout and Structure**
   - **Page Orientation**: Vertical scrolling layout optimized for mobile portrait mode (e.g., iPhone/Android standard widths ~375-414px).
   - **Header**: Fixed or sticky top bar with the title "Dashboard" centered or left-aligned in bold sans-serif font (18-24pt, #212529 color). Include a gear icon (24px, #6C757D) on the right for quick access to settings.
   - **Content Flow**: Stacked sections from top to bottom:
     1. Financial Summary Cards (Income, Expenses, Charity, Investments).
     2. Recent Transactions list.
   - **Spacing**: Medium padding (16px) between sections; small padding (8px) within cards. Use generous white space (24px vertical gaps) to separate summaries from transactions for visual breathing room.
   - **Background**: Solid white (#FFFFFF) with no gradients or patterns to maintain cleanliness.
   - **Scroll Behavior**: Smooth vertical scroll; no horizontal elements. Ensure the page fits key summaries above the fold (visible without scrolling on standard screens).

#### 2. **Color Scheme**
   - **Neutral Base**: White background (#FFFFFF) for cards and page; light beige/peach (#FFE5D9 or similar) for card backgrounds in summary sections to add subtle warmth and differentiation.
   - **Text Colors**: Primary text (#212529) for labels and values; secondary gray (#6C757D) for subtitles (e.g., "Received this month").
   - **Accent Colors**: Blue (#007BFF) for interactive elements like the floating "+" button. No semantic colors (green/red) in summaries to keep neutral; reserve for transactions (green #28A745 for positive, red #DC3545 for negative amounts).
   - **Icon Backgrounds**: Pastel rounded squares (e.g., green #D4EDDA for money bag, orange #FFE5D9 for credit card, pink #F8D7DA for heart, beige #FFF3CD for chart).
   - **Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards (ratio >4.5:1); e.g., dark text on light backgrounds.

#### 3. **Typography**
   - **Title**: "Dashboard" – Bold, 20-24pt sans-serif (e.g., Roboto Bold or SF Pro Bold).
   - **Section Headings**: E.g., "Recent Transactions" – Bold, 16-18pt, #212529.
   - **Key Values**: E.g., "$2,500" – Extra bold, 24-32pt, #212529 for emphasis.
   - **Labels**: E.g., "Income" – Regular, 14-16pt, #6C757D (secondary).
   - **Subtitles**: E.g., "Received this month" – Regular, 12-14pt, #6C757D.
   - **Transaction Details**: Vendor names (14pt bold), categories (12pt regular, #6C757D), amounts (14pt bold, colored green/red).
   - **Consistency**: Limit to one font family; left-align all text except amounts (right-aligned in lists).

#### 4. **Components and Elements**
   - **Summary Cards**:
     - Structure: Horizontal layout within rounded cards (12px radius, subtle shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)).
     - Left: Text stack (label, value, subtitle).
     - Right: Thematic image (e.g., money bag for Income) in a rounded square (48-64px, photographic or illustrative style).
     - Examples:
       - Income: Label "Income", value "$2,500", subtitle "Received this month", image: Green money bag.
       - Expenses: Label "Expenses", value "$1,200", subtitle "Spent this month", image: Credit card.
       - Charity: Label "Charity", value "$100", subtitle "Donated this month", image: Heart organ.
       - Investments: Label "Investments", value "$5,000", subtitle "Current value", image: Upward chart.
     - No progress bars here (unlike other pages); focus on static summaries.
   - **Recent Transactions Section**:
     - Heading: "Recent Transactions" – Bold, 16pt, left-aligned.
     - List Items: Stacked cards (8px radius, white background, no shadow).
       - Layout: Icon (24px, colored circle: blue for groceries, green for salary, etc.) left; Vendor and category center (stacked); Amount right (bold, green/red).
       - Examples:
         - Icon: Shopping cart (blue circle), "Fresh Foods Market" (bold), "Groceries" (gray), "-$85.50" (red).
         - Icon: Dollar sign (blue circle), "Tech Solutions Inc." (bold), "Salary" (gray), "+$2,500" (green).
         - Icon: Fork/knife (blue circle), "The Italian Place" (bold), "Dining" (gray), "-$45.75" (red).
         - Icon: Heart (blue circle), "Local Animal Shelter" (bold), "Donation" (gray), amount (red, if expense).
       - Limit to 4-5 items visible; imply scrolling or "more" if needed.
     - Floating Action Button: Blue circle "+" (48px diameter, bottom-right aligned over list) for adding transactions.
   - **Bottom Navigation Bar**:
     - Fixed at bottom: Four icons (24px, #6C757D) with labels below (12pt gray).
     - Items: Home (house, selected/highlighted), Transactions (list), Analytics (bar chart), Settings (gear).
     - Style: White background, centered icons, no dividers.

#### 5. **Icons and Visuals**
   - **Style**: Flat, outline or filled icons (e.g., from Material Design or custom): shopping cart for groceries, dollar for salary, fork/knife for dining, heart for donation.
   - **Size**: 24px within 40px colored circles (pastel backgrounds matching category).
   - **Images**: Realistic stock photos (e.g., money bag) in summary cards; rounded squares (64px), right-aligned.
   - **No Animations Specified**: Assume subtle fade-ins on load; no heavy effects to keep performance light.

#### 6. **Interaction and UX Principles**
   - **Glanceability**: Key metrics (income/expenses) prominent at top; users should grasp net position in <5 seconds.
   - **Tap Targets**: Minimum 48x48px for icons/buttons (e.g., "+", gear, nav items).
   - **Navigation**: Tapping summaries could expand details (e.g., to full category view); tapping transactions opens edit mode.
   - **Feedback**: No visible errors here; if data is outdated, add a subtle refresh icon.
   - **Accessibility**: Alt text for images (e.g., "Money bag icon for income"); voice-over support for screen readers (e.g., "Income: two thousand five hundred dollars received this month").
   - **Edge Cases**: Handle zero values gracefully (e.g., "$0" grayed out); scale for larger screens by centering content.
   - **User Flow**: Entry point for the app; encourages scrolling to transactions, then navigating via bottom bar.

#### 7. **Consistency with App-Wide Rules**
   - Aligns with general app design: Minimalist, blue accents, rounded elements, semantic colors in transactions.
   - Differs by using photographic images in summaries for visual appeal, not present in other pages like Add Transaction.

These rules can be used to replicate or iterate on the Dashboard page precisely, ensuring it remains intuitive and visually engaging.
